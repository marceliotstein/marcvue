I\'m blown away by Vue because it unlocks the power of comprehensive client-side web architecture, a paradigm that overturns the familiar server-side approach that became second nature to me in my years as a <a href="/#/projects/php">PHP developer</a> specializing in <a href="/#/projects/drupal">Drupal</a> and <a href="/#/projects/wordpress">WordPress</a>.</p>I believe Drupal and WordPress still hold an important place in the field of enterprise web development, but I expect that these server-side frameworks will be increasingly occupied with the important task of managing and presenting data via REST APIs. The creation of user experiences (which is, really, where a lot of the magic of web development lies) will become the responsibility of client-side frameworks. Before building this site, I evaulated several great front-end offerings including Angular, React, Ember and even a full Node-based server-side CMS called Keystone along with Vue. I finally selected Vue, based partly on word of mouth and also on the fact that it is less dependent (unlike Angular and React) on tech-giant sponsorship.</p><p>Learning Vue has been a joyful experience for me, because it has so many cool features, and also because the thrill of change has always been a part of my life as a web developer. As the project summaries featured on this portfolio website show, I have always made it a point to move on to new paradigms as the field evolves. I began developing professional websites in the <a href="/#/projects/early">early days</a> of Perl and flat HTML, then became a <a href="/#/projects/java">Java developer</a> before moving on to Drupal and WordPress. Even in today\'s Javascript-heavy web environment, change remains a constant, and there\'s no telling what innovations will reveal themselves next.</p><p>I consider myself a well-rounded web developer because I am an experienced writer and UX designer as well as a coder, and thus I have a good understanding of how the web projects I work on can add value to the editors, content creators, graphic artists and experience designers whose ideas we are supporting. I specialize in enterprise content management systems, and am particularly keen on <a href="/#/projects/seo">search development, SEO techniques and metadata</a> as well as on the power of well-planned <a href="/#/projects/social">social media initiatives</a> to support a web publisher\'s mission. I am more of a developer than a designer, but I do also have some training in graphic design, and have enjoyed the chance to implement some of my own <a href="/#/projects/design">UX designs</a>.</p><p>I am often hired to manage teams or projects, but as a manager I always insist on participating as a fully hands-on team member, because I know I cannot be an effective manager unless I understand the technology my team is using.
