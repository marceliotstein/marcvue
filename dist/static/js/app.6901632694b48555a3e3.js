Greenberg). I also enjoy initiating my own projects, like Pacifism21.org, which I kicked off with an Indiegogo fundraising drive in 2015.

I have managed, led or participated in talented web teams on ambitious projects for Meredith (Shape), Washington Post/Slate (Foreign Policy), A&E Network (History Channel), Sony Music and Time Warner.",catContinued:"Content management is an endlessly fascinating field, because public presentation is often just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to business goals for rich content data stores. Comprehensive understanding of taxonomy and metadata is essential, not just for searchability but also in order to increase the intrinsic value of the information being organized. Synchronizing tech strategy with a deep understanding of the social media landscape is also essential: a smart and well-integrated Facebook, Twitter or Snapchat strategy can be incredibly effective for media companies. For all of these reasons, the technology department of a major media or entertainment company can and should be a center of innovation, and I always enjoy the opportunity to be a part of this kind of team."},{catPath:"musiclit",catTitle:"Music & Literature",catDesc:"It's been a thrill for me to build world-class websites for musicians and writers I deeply care about, including Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam. I recently worked on the redesign of the Allen Ginsberg Project, an exciting deep-content dive into the archives of this great American poet. I've been running my own literary blog, Literary Kicks, since 1994, one of the longest-running blogs in the world. Other projects include a cartooning website for my father, Eli Stein, and the original launch of Words Without Borders, an enduring resource for international literature.",catContinued:"Perhaps the reason I gravitate towards public-facing digital projects is that I have always seen web publishing as a creative endeavor. This is a field that rewards experimentation, vivid and attractive design, and substantial, deep-content taxonomical structure. I always approach a web project as an exciting intellectual pursuit. Maybe this is one reason I've managed to keep my own popular book blog Literary Kicks alive and kicking even as other small-scale or personal web projects have fallen by the wayside. It's simple: I'm devoted to the art of web publishing, and I treat content like it matters."},{catPath:"hlg",catTitle:"Health, Law & Government",catDesc:"Many of my projects has been on behalf of government/healthcare organizations, including the launch of the Community Guide for the Center for Disease Control and a Department of Labor initiative, the Virtual Career Network, designed to steer young people into either health technology or green technology. I also built an alternative health e-commerce site for WellFormative.com and a book site for an expert in group psychology. On the legal front, I was part of an innovative project to build an advanced high-performance search engine for law firms at Inference Data, and designed a custom website for a New York City law firm.",catContinued:"There are a wide variety of projects and technologies represented in this part of my portfolio: Java, Drupal, Javascript, lots of custom CSS. These projects tended to involve mission-critical database integration, often using MySQL, Solr and MongoDB.

I've written constantly about social and political concerns on my blog Literary Kicks, and in 2015 I launched Pacifism for the 21st Century, an anti-war project, with an Indiegogo fundraising drive. I've put the wonderful poetry archives of my activist/poet friend Eliot Katz online, and am also very proud to help spread the defiant, expansive spirit of literary expression with my work on the Allen Ginsberg Project and the Words Without Borders nonprofit organization. I'm also recently involved with World Beyond War, and am active in various #resistance activities on behalf of fair democracy and freedom of the press in the United States of America.",catContinued:"As an activist who gets fired up by positive cultural change, I often look to the power of open source software development itself as a great living example of the power of generosity, community and trust-based cooperation on a global scale. The first great community-based software project I was exposed to, years ago, was the Unix operating system, which of course evolved into Linux and MacOS. Later, I became a part of the wonderful Drupal community. The values and ethics of these open source movements is all the evidence we need to prove to ourselves and others that humans are capable of creating miraculous things together."},{catPath:"php",catTitle:"PHP",catDesc:"I began working with PHP in 2003 as the founding developer for Words Without Borders, a journal of international literature. I built a custom CMS all by myself for this early project, but was soon turned on to WordPress and Drupal, two PHP-based platforms that prove the amazing power of open source community-based software development.",catContinued:"As a highly multilingual software developer, I think of PHP as a good general purpose language, notable mainly not for any unique syntactical characteristics but simply for its strong position in the web ecosystem. PHP is a great language to use because it's been completely proven as a stable, reliable component of high-performance, high-demand web server architectures, and because it's so well represented by an enthusiastic, approachable expert user base within the important community of open source developers."},{catPath:"drupal",catTitle:"Drupal",catDesc:"Drupal has been my server framework of choice since 2009, when I was hired by Washington Post/Slate to manage a fast-moving Drupal team for Foreign Policy magazine.

I believe it is the most mature, well-established and important web framework in the world, as is evidenced by its impressive market share. I also think there is no better tool for server-side system integration, user authentication, security and enterprise-level content management. Where Drupal's position in the world is fast changing, though, is in the area of presentation. I would no longer use Drupal's theme layer to implement a design. Instead, I think Drupal's role will be strongest in the presentation of JSON-based REST services for Javascript-based front end frameworks like React and Vue to use. This is a big change for the Drupal community, but fortunately it's a change that the leaders of the Drupal community are fully supportive of, which is a real sign of how strong this leadership is."},{catPath:"java",catTitle:"Java",catDesc:"I don't prefer to specialize in Java anymore, but I was one of the early adopters when this comprehensive and ambitious language was invented in 1995.
