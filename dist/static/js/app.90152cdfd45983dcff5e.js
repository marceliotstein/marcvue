When I graduated from the University at Albany with a degree in Philosophy and another in Computer Science, the hottest languages on the scene were Pascal and LISP. I found my way from there to Unix and C++, and was working as a financial systems developer on Wall Street (want the long story? <a target="_blank" href="http://litkicks.com/AMemoirInProgress">Here it is</a>) when the Internet craze began in the 90s. I <a href="/#/projects/early">jumped aboard</a>, became a <a href="/#/projects/java">Java developer</a>, and stumbled my way through various nascent content management strategies until I discovered the Drupal and WordPress communities, which continue to inspire me today. I still have great respect for the smart and generous people who make these open source frameworks as great as they are, but I believe web developers need to find a new "north star" to follow in 2018, and when I gaze skyward and look for that north star I see brilliant Javascript frameworks: Node, Angular, React and (my current favorite, though I love to experiment with them all) Vue.</p><p>I am not only a web developer. I am a writer (I used to use the pen name <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Asher">Levi Asher</a>), a political activist for causes that matter, and a proud father of three. As a technologist, I pay a lot of attention to <a href="/#/projects/seo">search technology, taxonomies and metadata</a>, and am particularly keen on the power of well-planned <a href="/#/projects/social">social media strategies</a>.</p><p>I am often asked to play the role of project manager, team leader or lead architect on the projects I work on, but I always insist on participating as a fully hands-on developer as well, because I cannot be an effective manager unless I understand the technologies my team is using.
